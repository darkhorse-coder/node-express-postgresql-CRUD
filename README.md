 # Node Js Project Structure
 
 Recently i have started working on a new project and the issue that i faced was spending a lot of time building the project structure based on the best practices ,especially with java script that have a lot of approaches and bad parts and i couldn't find any place that wrap the best practices into a single project ,so i decided to make it by my own. 
 
in this repository i dont aim to provide optimal solution as each project have its own necesitty ,but to help anyone that is starting with a node js project and cant find any inspiration on how to start building the project to take this project as the starting point.
 
 some of the good practices followed in this repository:
 - Async/Await support 
 - WinstonJs Logger Implementation
 - Error Handling
 - Sequelize Support 
 - Open Api Specification implemented through swagger-jsdocs and swagger-ui
 - Jwt implementation 
 - Enviroment variables to hold configuration values .env file
 - OOP (object oriented programming)
 - i've followed [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) Coding standard with a eslint ,help to keep thing into prespective.

please feel free to :star:  happy programming :smiley: :v:
