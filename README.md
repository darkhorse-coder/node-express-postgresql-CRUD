 # Node Js Project Structure
 
 recently i have started working on a new project and the issue that i faced was spending a lot of time building the project structure based on the best practices ,espicially with java script that have a lot of approaches and bad parts and i couldnt find any place that wrap the best practices into a single project ,so i decided to make it by my own. 
 
in this repository i dont aim to provide optimal solution as each project have his own neccsaty ,but to help any body who is starting with a node js project and cant find any inspiration on how to start building the project to take this project as the starting point.i've followed [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) Coding standard with a eslint help to keep thing into prespective.
 
 

please feel free to :star:  happy programming :smiley: :v:
